                    <p>"Intellect and wisdom are evenly distributed among the people on earth, although some think otherwise. Economy and prosperity, however, is very unevenly distributed in the world. "- Koffi Annan</p>    
                    <p style="darkblue"><strong>ARO FABLAB</strong> was founded in 2007 under ARC-KENYA, a local NGO with the mission of fighting poverty by doing things differently.This is how the Fablab was started in the rural parts of Siaya County in Majiwa</p>
                    <p>The launch which was presided over by then the Minister for Foreign Affairs Hon. Raphael Tuju and Haakoon Karlsen of Fab Foundation</p>
                        <a href="http://www.fablab.no/index.php/news-nyheter/144-128">See this</a>
                     <p>We provide a space for local Entreprenuers, Designers, Craftsmen, Engineers,Educators, Students and all other creative thinkers where they can test their curocity under support from other Fablabers.</p>
                        
                    
                    <p>Apart from the FABLAB, ARC KENYA also run other programs including;
                    <ol>&#9679; Child Care Program</ol>
                    <ol>&#9679; Child Protection Program</ol>
                    <ol>&#9679; Agriculture Program &amp;</ol>
                    <ol>&#9679; Enviromental Management</ol>
                    
                    Under this, Fablab plays a central role of repairing the solar lamps distributed in the community by the Organization. Fablab also in partnership with Kisumu Polytechnic Engineering Department continues research on possible solar cooker</p><br>

                    <p>ARC KENYA also provides accomodation and good conference facility to both locals and international visitors and Ecotourism services as well</p><br>
                    
                    
                    <p>Being situated in the rural part of the country which also experience high poverty level, same predicaments have always followed our Fablab. Very few people realise the usefulness of the lab and even the technical schools available are several Kilometres away so we decided to introduce Fab Kids program.</p>
               
            <p>Apart from the Fab Kids, ARO Fablab have fabricated afew things in the past. These include earings made from the mangoe seed, simple footwares including the much talked about- OBAMA SHOE. The Obama Shoe was done with help of the then visiting Fablaber Jens Dyvik of  <a href="http://www.fellesverkstedet.no/">Fellesverktedet Fablab</a> Fablab-Norway. In his around the world visit to Fablabs and Hack Spaces, he had visited Fablab Kamakura-Japan before coming to ARO Fablab where he learnt how they were making shoes from their lab. He then help requesting for the files for the shoes which flew digitally to our Lab then an engravement of President Obama's image was added. More designs came up and additions to the designs including usage of Fish skin as inner sole. This concept blew big when the shoe was presented to Mama Sarah Obama whose home is just few kilometres way and Jens further used it in a big presentation at TEDx Copenhagensalon<a href="https://youtu.be/tVnCb-zCXxw">Obama Shoe</a><br> and
               
            <p>Other Projects done include prototyping gravity light where the gears were cut from from a board and simple wiring done.</p>
            <p>In the recent past, our lab decided to help bring a simple solution to motocycle riders'(major means of transport in the rural area) mobile phone charging challenge. The goal was to ensure their phones are charged as they work and so the concept was introduction of small DC (Direct Current) CHARGER which then get conneted to the wetcell directly and they use to charge their phones while at work. This was considered a relief the riders and their customers who at times miss them while their phone are off due to lack of power</p>
